# Add Accessibility Features to Backend API

## Problem Statement
The current backend API lacks essential accessibility features that would enable users with disabilities to interact with our application more effectively. We need to enhance our API to ensure compliance with accessibility standards and improve user experience for all.

## Proposed Solution
1. Review current API endpoints and identify areas lacking accessibility features.
2. Implement necessary changes to support accessibility standards.
3. Ensure thorough testing with users who have disabilities to validate improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints meet WCAG standards.
- [ ] User testing feedback is documented and addressed.
- [ ] Documentation updates to reflect changes.
